 * which is exactly where the colour changes fastest. PLACEHOLDER exponent, tuned by eye.
 *
 * This is also why the ladder is not drawn in a perceptually uniform space, which would make the
 * bias unnecessary and every rung equally loud. That was tried: flat OKLCH lightness and chroma
 * hold the rungs beautifully even, and stop the band looking like a rainbow at all — because

 * because the page behind it is pink — a loud magenta on a pink page reads as the page turned up
 * too far, where a loud green simply reads as green.
 *
 * So the cool end is damped until it weighs what the warm end weighs: level 1 comes out at a Lab
 * chroma of 55 against level 7's 52, where a flat 80% had them at 75 and 52. It leaves the warm

 * run is about to be played on is stated before it starts.
 *
 * A stripe is a level: one fixed board, the same for every player, and how near its best run
 * came to that level's target — written twice over, as a percentage and as how far along the
 * stripe the solid colour reaches (see game/levels.ts). Once it has been finished it also
 * offers the 🎲 — the same
 * size dealt from a fresh seed, which scores nothing and is there to be played for its own
 * sake. Which is why the offer is two buttons and not one: the level is the thing with a
 * record attached, and the random board is the thing to do once the record is set.
 *
 * The screen always opens with something picked, and the pick climbs: a new player finds the
 * bottom stripe ready to play, and finishing a run leaves the one above it ready instead. So
 * the ladder is walked by pressing the same button over and over, and picking a stripe is
 * something a player does only to break step — to replay one, or to skip ahead.
