/**
 * The levels: one per rung of MAP_SIZES, and each of them one number. A board is fully
 * determined by its seed (see random-utils), so a curated level is nothing but the seed it is
 * built from — there is no level data in the bundle, and replaying one costs a call to
 * createGameMap rather than a snapshot.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDER seeds, re-picked 2026-09-12 over seeds 1-40 on every board. For each rung, the
 * seed whose score under the `mixed` bot sits closest to the median of the forty — a map that is
 * neither a gift nor a punishment, so the ladder climbs on the board getting bigger rather than
 * on the luck of the deal. On the three boards with an opponent, closeness of the two sides'
 * scores counts as well: a seed the rival runs away with, or one the player's corner owns, is
 * not a race whatever its median says. Small numbers because nothing needs them to be large and
 * short numbers cost less.
 *
 * The medians they were picked against: 264, 1078, 1302, 2162, 2871, 4700, 6365.
 *
 * The shortlist was then *looked at*, which is the half no median can do — a custard sitting in
 * a board corner is a tile nobody will ever walk in to use, a portal pair that skips four tiles
 * is not a portal, and a shower three tiles from a base is a building worth nothing to raise.
 * The last of those turned out to be common enough to fix in the generator instead (see
 * placeObject), which is why these seeds are younger than the sweep above them.
 *
 * Level 3 is picked on a third thing again: its *band*. All forty 9x9 seeds were played twenty
 * times over with nothing varied but the seed the bot's tie-breaks come off, and three of them —
 * including the one the median first chose — came back with the same score twenty times out of
 * twenty. A board with one run in it is a board where nothing a player decides can matter, which
 * no median will ever report. Seed 2's band is 47% of its median wide and its own run sits on
 * that median, so it is a middling board that can still be played well or badly.
 *
 * The tutorial is the one picked against that rule. Its ceiling is 400 — two rainbows, two
 * unicorns, no cloud left — and half the seeds have no way to reach it: the second unicorn is
 * in the present, and a present without one in it caps the board at 176 whatever anybody does.
 * Level 1 is where the whole loop is taught, so it is a board where the loop can actually be
 * completed, which is what makes its ceiling a target worth setting (see LEVEL_TARGETS).
 *
 * **These are tied to the generation code.** Everything in createGameMap comes off the one
 * seeded generator in the order it is rolled, so adding, removing or reordering a roll builds
 * a different map from the same number — and the targets below, which were measured on these
 * maps, stop describing them. Re-run the bot and re-pick both lists when that happens.

/**
 * What 100% is worth on each level: the best run played on that board.
 *
 * **PLACEHOLDER, and a weaker claim than usual right now.** These were Almut's own bests, which
 * is what the number is *for* — full marks as "as well as this board has ever been played" — but
 * those bests were set on boards that no longer exist: the lollipop became a light source, the
 * fountains halved, every source took a boulder, and the seeds were re-picked underneath them.
 * So these are the shipped bot's best tie-break roll on each board (BOT_MAX_SCORES below),
 * which makes full marks temporarily mean "as well as the opponent has ever played it". They go
 * back to being records the moment Almut plays these seven boards.
 *
 * Level 1 is the exception and always will be: 400 is the board's ceiling — two rainbows, two
 * unicorns, no cloud left (see LEVEL_SEEDS) — so its 100% is perfection rather than a best, and
 * the bot's 384 is a board played nearly perfectly rather than a target.
 *
 * **Updating one after a better run:** multiply the old target by the percentage the run came
 * out at. It pins exactly, and not by luck — the panel rounds the percentage to a whole number,
 * so a reading of p% puts the score inside a band half a percent wide either way, and getPercent
 * rounds by the same half percent. For any p at or above 100 the whole band comes back out as
 * 100%, whatever the score inside it actually was.
 *
 * The bot's own scores on these boards are in BOT_MIN_SCORES / BOT_MAX_SCORES below, which
 * `npm run levels` re-measures. Read them whenever the economy moves and the ladder has to be
 * re-read: what the bot makes of a board is the one reading of it that does not need playing.

/**
 * What the game's own opponent scores on each level, as the two ends of one band: the shipped
 * `mixed` bot on that exact board, with nothing varied but the seed its tie-breaks come off
 * (twenty of them, 1000-1019, via `npm run levels`). Both rows are runs the opponent really
 * had — the same bot on a bad day and on a good one — which is what makes them a pair rather
 * than a number and an error bar.
 *
 * **Nothing reads these yet.** They are here for the second score target — "beat the bot"
 * beside LEVEL_TARGETS' "beat the author" — and are deliberately unused until that lands. They
 * cost the bundle nothing while they are: both arrays tree-shake out, measured at no change to
 * the packed zip.
 *
 * The run a player actually faces is neither row: it is `mixed` seeded from the *map* seed,
 * which is what the game does (resetBot in game-map.component.ts) — 368, 1000, 1400, 2475,
 * 2871, 4655, 6270. It is at the top of the band on the tutorial and the 7x7, exactly on the
 * median on the 9x9, and below it on the three boards with a rival — one seeded run is a fact
 * about that seed and not about the bot.
 *
 * How wide these bands are is worth reading on its own: the 17x17's runs 2200 to 4320 on one
 * board with nothing changed but which way a tie fell. That is the game having genuinely
 * different runs in it, and it is also why a single-seed reading of anything should be taken
 * lightly — `explore` beats `mixed` on level 6 in the strategy table `npm run levels` prints,
 * and the 30-seed sweep behind STRATEGY_WEIGHTS says that is this seed, not the weights.
 * Whichever row a target ends up reading, the number the player watches on screen on the three
 * boards with a rival is lower again — the dark side gives up the closing turn (see hasGo).
 *
 * MAX is a lower bound rather than a ceiling: twenty seeds is what was rolled, and rolling more
 * can only ever find a better run. Re-measure both when the economy moves.
