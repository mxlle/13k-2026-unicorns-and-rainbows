# Submission artwork — thumbnail & cover

Neither of these is in the zip. They are the two images the js13k submission form asks for, and
they have their own limits, which `build.mjs` checks rather than trusts:

| file                 | size      | limit  | currently |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- |
| `thumbnail-320.png`  | 320 × 320 | 64 kB  | ~55 kB    |
| `cover-800x500.png`  | 800 × 500 | 256 kB | ~115 kB   |

Both are written to the repo root.

```bash
npm run images            # both
npm run images -- thumb   # just the thumbnail
npm run images -- cover   # just the cover
```

## How it works

`art.html` draws both images; `build.mjs` shoots them with headless Chrome, scales down and runs
the repo's own `ect` over the result. Nothing is screenshotted out of the running game — the art
is emoji on a CSS gradient, so a browser draws it directly, and re-cutting after a visual change
is one command instead of a session of temporarily breaking the stylesheet to get a clean shot.

**To look at either one while editing, open `thumbnail/art.html` in a browser** — plain, no build
step. Append `?target=cover` for the cover.

## When the game's visuals change

The ladder's palette is **read out of the game**, not copied. `build.mjs` scrapes it from
`launch-screen.component.ts` (`VIOLET_HUE`, `WARM_BIAS`, `NEIGHBOUR_HUE_STEP`, the two
`SATURATION_*`), `launch-screen.module.scss` (`$stripe-lightness` and its drop) and `MAP_SIZES`
in `game-map.ts` — so changing the launch screen changes the artwork on the next run, including
adding or removing a board, which changes the number of rungs.

Those lookups are regexes, so **renaming one of those constants breaks this script** — on
purpose. Each one throws by name rather than quietly falling back to a stale number, so a broken
run tells you which constant moved. Point the regex at wherever it went.

Two things are *not* scraped and have to be kept in step by hand:

- `.dark { filter: invert(1) }` in `art.html` mirrors the rule of the same name in
  `game-map.module.scss`. That is how the opponent's things are drawn.
- the emoji in each board come from `OBJECT_CONFIG` in `game-objects.ts`. If an object's glyph
  changes, change it here too.

## The knobs, all at the top of `art.html`

- **`FLAT_RUNGS`** (on) — flat rungs instead of the launch screen's top-to-bottom gradient. The
  gradient is only ~4 points of lightness and near-invisible at these sizes, but it forces the PNG
  to carry a smooth ramp. That is what made the file too big to keep lossless, and quantising to
  fit is what put visible banding in the gradients. Flat rungs compress well enough that both
  files stay **lossless**, so there is nothing left to band. Turning this off will very likely put
  the thumbnail back over 64 kB.
- **`RUNG_BORDER`** (off) — the 1px/3px rim the launch screen's stripes wear. At these sizes it is
  mostly noise and it costs a colour transition on every rung edge.
- **`TILE_ALPHA`** (0.82) — how opaque a board tile is over the ladder. At 0.82 the board reads as
  solid and the rainbow becomes a frame around it; at ~0.55 the ladder reads *through* the board
  and the whole picture is markedly more colourful. Worth trying if either image looks washed out.
- **`TARGETS`** — the two boards themselves: grid pitch, tile size, which emoji sit where, and the
  hero unicorn's size and position.

## Why the cover's board looks like that

It is laid out to match what `setMapSize` and the placement code in `game-map.ts` actually
generate, so it is a plausible board rather than a pretty arrangement:

| on the board            | the rule behind it                                              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛁 / 🦄 mirrored corners | each side starts in its own corner                              |
| ⛲ with a 🍭 beside it   | a tree grows next to every fountain at generation               |
| 🌈 only next to a ⛲     | a rainbow is cast by a unicorn standing beside a fountain       |
| 🪣 dead centre          | `getTile(map, { x: middle, y: middle })` — the contested tub site |
| 🍩 ×2, far apart        | donuts are a portal *pair* or nothing                           |
| 🍮 ~1 per 12 tiles      | `CUSTARD_COUNT`                                                  |
| 🎁 ~1 per 45 tiles      | `CHEST_DENSITY`                                                  |
| ☁️ in two corners       | the fog, where neither side has walked yet                      |
| inverted glyphs         | the opponent's three objects — `getSide()` and `.dark`          |

The densities are read against a 40-tile crop of a board big enough to have a rival at all
(`RIVAL_SIZE` is 17), which is why both sides appear on it.

## Gotchas

- **The emoji are Noto**, pulled from Google Fonts, so the artwork looks the same wherever it is
  cut. The competition build makes no external requests, so a player sees their own system emoji
  — on a Mac, Apple's. The images are deliberately *not* a promise about that.
- **The 2× capture-and-downscale is macOS-only** (it uses `sips`); elsewhere the script captures
  at 1× and the emoji edges are slightly softer.
- Set `CHROME=/path/to/chrome` if the script cannot find a browser.
